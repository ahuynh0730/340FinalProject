# 340FinalProject
Final Project for CS340

https://restaurant-ordering.herokuapp.com/

This project connects a website to a database in order to obtain, add, or modify information.

The database contains a list of customers, employees, menu items, and orders placed.

The website allows a user to add/delete/modify customers, employees, menu items, or orders(add only).

If being used, rename dbcon-template.js to dbcon.js after providing own information.
